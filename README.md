# Data-Structures
This is an experimental project which uses several different data structures to see which operations they do optimally. These operations include: adding an element to the structure, deleting an element from the structure and updating an element in the structure. After the implentations are done, these structures are grouped and tested on how efficient they are on growing databases. Their performance can be seen in the Performances folder.
# What I Learned
- Coding in C++
- How to implement various data structures
- How different data structures work on different operations
- How choose the optimal data structure for my objective
